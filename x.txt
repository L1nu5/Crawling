I am using it from last 1 month. From my personal experience am giving this review.

What Inside the pack:
1. OnePlus 3.
2. Screen Protector (pre-applied).
3. Dash Charge Type-C Cable.
4. Dash Charge Adapter.
5. SIM Tray Ejector.
6. Quick Start Guide.

# Things that i liked most:
1. Dash Charge feature is awesome. Its really fast. 10% to 80% is getting charged quickly after that it taking long time to fully charge.
2. It made with metal but it did't heats up while charging which is a good thing. Good job OnePlus.
3. I have some good experience with stock android, but after using Oxigen OS i really happy. It make your phone usage much better. You can easily customize your phone with cool features. Oh! i forgot to say that there is no lag:)
4. If i about gaming then this is my first time when i play a high graphic games without lag. If you are gamer then it is best for you.
5. If you want to know about RAM then i want to say this make your phone better. I have seen some complaints about RAM management. But after the last update OnePlus able to solve it.
6. The color reproduction is great on 16MP primary camera. Front camera is also takes pretty good pictures. Both, indoor and outdoor pic is awesome. Pictures are better than any other phone in price segment.
7. Battery also seems good. If you charge it fully in morning then you can use it full day easily.
8. Call quality is excellent it is loud and clear. Till this time I didn't face any problem.
9. The phone feels great when you hold it in your hand. Metal body make it looks wonderful.
10. The Fingerprint scanner is also working smoothly. No issues over here.

# Things that i disliked:
1. Dash charging works only when you use the USB cum charging cable which is provided by OnePlus. So if you want to use any other USB cum charging cable then it won't work.
2. If you want to take pictures with Single LED flash then it can not take that good quality.
3. The headphone jack gives me problems sometime.
4. Speaker is not that loud.( but still that not a big problem)

# My personal opinion:
This phone is a strong competitor with other phones( In this price). I would suggest you that go ahead and buy this.
